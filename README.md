Please Read This Before Ignoring This Organisation.


See guys some or the day we have to collaborate, some or the other way.
Bonding between all branches needs to be stong, let's not keep our talents with ourselves.
Let's promote opensource, and open learning .
As you see there our college alumni, are doing something for our college, if they are doing it after going out of this college why cant we ?
We are here and have to be here for some years and some of us would be after college. 
Anything you do in coding or something related dump it here making your own repository(make it public thoughðŸ˜… ) so that we can learn from each other.
Guys, I dont want to make these things simply, but I mean it if not in this year lets do it next year after branch entry, its not compulsory, Ill not force you also but Let's give it a try.
I'll be sharing some seriously good books for python or somethings related to opensource.



And if possible everyone download slack only for official things. If you are in this with me PLEASE send your email registered in slack.
THANK YOU.
